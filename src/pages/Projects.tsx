            <p>
              An AI search platform with a <strong>typed algebra of retrieval components</strong> that <strong>spans the design space</strong> of hybrid RAG systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by Docker/Kubernetes, it includes a <strong>custom state and image manager</strong> for reproducible system execution, and a <strong>live monitoring interface</strong> for benchmarking and feedback-driven evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Planned to be released alongside a <strong>system-design paper</strong> and <strong>open-source release</strong>.

            <p>
              WildFins is a <strong>PyTorch-based framework</strong> for large-scale video model experimentation, designed to support rapid benchmarking of video understanding models. Inspired by DeepMindâ€™s VideoReader, it enables <strong>efficient, reproducible training</strong> over long-form, multi-part videos with minimal overhead.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-2">
              <li><strong>Clean separation</strong> between model, data, and evaluation configuration</li>
              <li><strong>Full reproducibility</strong> of training runs</li>
              <li><strong>Seamless scaling</strong> to multi-GPU setups and long video sequences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This framework powered the creation and benchmarking of a <strong>new in-situ animal behavior dataset</strong> for <strong>NeurIPS 2025</strong> (Datasets and Benchmarks track, under review).
